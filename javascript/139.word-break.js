 * Testcase Example:  '"leetcode"\n["leet","code"]'
 *
 * Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of
 * non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated
 * sequence of one or more dictionary words.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the
 * segmentation.
 * You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet
 * code".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple
 * pen apple".
 * Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
 * Output: false
