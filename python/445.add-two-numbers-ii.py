#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes
# contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
# 
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
# 
# Follow up:
# What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the
# lists is not allowed.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
