#
# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the
# given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of
# the BST.
# 
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
# 
# Search for a node to remove.
# If the node is found, delete the node.
# 
# 
# 
# Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).
# 
# Example:
# 
# root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# key = 3
# 
# ⁠   5
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 3   6
# ⁠/ \   \
# 2   4   7
# 
# Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
# 
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.
# 
# ⁠   5
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 4   6
# ⁠/     \
# 2       7
# 
# Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].
