#
# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find
# the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord,
# such that:
# 
# 
# Only one letter can be changed at a time.
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not
# a transformed word.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit",
# endWord = "cog",
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
# 
# Output: 5
# 
# Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" ->
# "dog" -> "cog",
# return its length 5.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# 
# Output: 0
# 
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible
# transformation.
