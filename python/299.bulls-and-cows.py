#
# You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write
# down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your
# friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in
# said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position
# (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in
# the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses
# and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
# 
# Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's
# guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows.Â 
# 
# Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate
# digits.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
# 
# Output: "1A3B"
# 
# Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
# 
# Output: "1A1B"
# 
# Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a
# cow.
# 
# Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only
# contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
