#
# Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep
# copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a
# list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# {"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
# 
# Explanation:
# Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
# Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
# Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
# Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
# The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no
# self-loops in the graph.
# Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q
# must have node p as neighbor too.
# You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned
# graph.
