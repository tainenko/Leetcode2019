#
# Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
# 
# Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another
# expression.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
# The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would
# always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero
# operation.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
# Output: 22
# Explanation: 
# ⁠ ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
# = (0 + 17) + 5
# = 17 + 5
# = 22
