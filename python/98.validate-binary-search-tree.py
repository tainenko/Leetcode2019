#
# Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
# 
# Assume a BST is defined as follows:
# 
# 
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
# key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
# node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# ⁠   2
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 1   3
# 
# Input: [2,1,3]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# ⁠   5
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 1   4
# / \
# 3   6
# 
# Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
#

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
