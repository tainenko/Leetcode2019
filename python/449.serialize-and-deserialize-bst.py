# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There
# is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should
# work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to
# a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
# 
# Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your
# serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
