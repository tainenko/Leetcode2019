#
# All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
# for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to
# identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
# 
# Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
# occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
# 
# Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
#
