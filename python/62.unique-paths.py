#
# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
# the diagram below).
# 
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
# is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in
# the diagram below).
# 
# How many possible unique paths are there?
# 
# 
# Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
# 
# Note: m and n will be at most 100.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: m = 3, n = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the
# bottom-right corner:
# 1. Right -> Right -> Down
# 2. Right -> Down -> Right
# 3. Down -> Right -> Right
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: m = 7, n = 3
# Output: 28
