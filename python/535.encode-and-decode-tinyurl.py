# Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design
# TinyURL.
# 
# TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such
# as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
# 
# Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no
# restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to
# ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be
# decoded to the original URL.

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
