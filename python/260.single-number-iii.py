# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1,3,2,5]'
#
# Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only
# once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements
# that appear only once.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
# Output: [3,5]
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is
# also correct.
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it using only constant space complexity?
