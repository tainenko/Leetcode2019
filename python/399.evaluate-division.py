#
# Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables
# represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given
# some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.
# 
# Example:
# Given  a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
# queries are:  a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
# return  [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
# 
# The input is:  vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>&
# values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries , where equations.size() ==
# values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations.
# Return  vector<double>.
# 
# According to the example above:
# 
# 
# equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
# values = [2.0, 3.0],
# queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"]
# ]. 
# 
# 
# 
# The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will
# result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
