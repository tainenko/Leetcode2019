#
# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level,
# and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following
# definition:
# 
# 
# struct Node {
# ⁠ int val;
# ⁠ Node *left;
# ⁠ Node *right;
# ⁠ Node *next;
# }
# 
# 
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
# next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
# 
# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input:
# {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}
# 
# Output:
# {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}
# 
# Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function
# should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like
# in Figure B.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You may only use constant extra space.
# Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra
# space for this problem.
