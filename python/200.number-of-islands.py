#
# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
# islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
# adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
# the grid are all surrounded by water.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
# 
# Output:Â 1
#

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 11000
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011
# 
# Output: 3
