# Testcase Example:  '5'
#
# Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if
# two adjacent bits will always have different values.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 5
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# The binary representation of 5 is: 101
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 7
# Output: False
# Explanation:
# The binary representation of 7 is: 111.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: 11
# Output: False
# Explanation:
# The binary representation of 11 is: 1011.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# Input: 10
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# The binary representation of 10 is: 1010.
