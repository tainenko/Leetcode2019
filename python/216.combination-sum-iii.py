# Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given
# that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a
# unique set of numbers.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All numbers will be positive integers.
# The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: k = 3, n = 7
# Output: [[1,2,4]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: k = 3, n = 9
# Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
