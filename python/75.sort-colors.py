#
# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place
# so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order
# red, white and blue.
# 
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white,
# and blue respectively.
# 
# Note:Â You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this
# problem.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting
# sort.
# First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite
# array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
# Could you come up with aÂ one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
