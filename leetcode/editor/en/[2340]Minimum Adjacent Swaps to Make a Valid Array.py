# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. 
# 
#  Swaps of adjacent elements are able to be performed on nums. 
# 
#  A valid array meets the following conditions: 
# 
#  
#  The largest element (any of the largest elements if there are multiple) is 
# at the rightmost position in the array. 
#  The smallest element (any of the smallest elements if there are multiple) is 
# at the leftmost position in the array. 
#  
# 
#  Return the minimum swaps required to make nums a valid array. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [3,4,5,5,3,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Perform the following swaps:
# - Swap 1: Swap the 3 ≥·µà and 4·µó ∞ elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,5,1].
# - Swap 2: Swap the 4·µó ∞ and 5·µó ∞ elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,1,5].
# - Swap 3: Swap the 3 ≥·µà and 4·µó ∞ elements, nums is then [3,4,5,1,3,5].
# - Swap 4: Swap the 2‚Åø·µà and 3 ≥·µà elements, nums is then [3,4,1,5,3,5].
# - Swap 5: Swap the 1À¢·µó and 2‚Åø·µà elements, nums is then [3,1,4,5,3,5].
# - Swap 6: Swap the 0·µó ∞ and 1À¢·µó elements, nums is then [1,3,4,5,3,5].
# It can be shown that 6 swaps is the minimum swaps required to make a valid 
# array.
#  
# 
# Example 2:
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [9]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The array is already valid, so we return 0.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 10‚Åµ 
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 10‚Åµ
