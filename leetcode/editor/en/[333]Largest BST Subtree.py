# Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a 
# Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number 
# of nodes. 
# 
#  A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-
# mentioned properties: 
# 
#  
#  The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) 
# node's value. 
#  The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) 
# node's value. 
#  
# 
#  Note: A subtree must include all of its descendants. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The 
# return value is the subtree's size, which is 3. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥ 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
