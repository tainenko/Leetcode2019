# Given the postfix tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return the 
# binary expression tree that represents this expression. 
# 
#  Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which 
# the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix 
# tokens of the expression 4*(5-(7+2)) are represented in the array postfix = ["4","5
# ","7","2","+","-","*"]. 
# 
#  The class Node is an interface you should use to implement the binary 
# expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the evaluate function, which 
# is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the Node class; 
# however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to 
# implement it if needed. 
# 
#  A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent 
# arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two 
# children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and 
# internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators '+' (
# addition), '-' (subtraction), '*' (multiplication), and '/' (division). 
# 
#  It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds 10‚Åπ in 
# absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero). 
# 
#  Follow up: Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular?
#  For example, is your design able to support additional operators without 
# making changes to your existing evaluate implementation? 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with 
# expression ((3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: s = ["4","5","2","7","+","-","*"]
# Output: -16
# Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with 
# expression 4*(5-(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length < 100 
#  s.length is odd. 
#  s consists of numbers and the characters '+', '-', '*', and '/'. 
#  If s[i] is a number, its integer representation is no more than 10‚Åµ. 
#  It is guaranteed that s is a valid expression. 
#  The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed 10‚Åπ.
#  
#  It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.
