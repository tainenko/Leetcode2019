# You have n buckets each containing some gallons of water in it, represented 
# by a 0-indexed integer array buckets, where the i·µó ∞ bucket contains buckets[i] 
# gallons of water. You are also given an integer loss. 
# 
#  You want to make the amount of water in each bucket equal. You can pour any 
# amount of water from one bucket to another bucket (not necessarily an integer). 
# However, every time you pour k gallons of water, you spill loss percent of k. 
# 
#  Return the maximum amount of water in each bucket after making the amount of 
# water equal. Answers within 10‚Åª‚Åµ of the actual answer will be accepted. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: buckets = [1,2,7], loss = 80
# Output: 2.00000
# Explanation: Pour 5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0].
# 5 * 80% = 4 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 5 - 4 = 1 gallon 
# of water.
# All buckets have 2 gallons of water in them so return 2.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: buckets = [2,4,6], loss = 50
# Output: 3.50000
# Explanation: Pour 0.5 gallons of water from buckets[1] to buckets[0].
# 0.5 * 50% = 0.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 0.5 - 0.25 =
#  0.25 gallons of water.
# Now, buckets = [2.25, 3.5, 6].
# Pour 2.5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0].
# 2.5 * 50% = 1.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 2.5 - 1.25 =
#  1.25 gallons of water.
# All buckets have 3.5 gallons of water in them so return 3.5.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: buckets = [3,3,3,3], loss = 40
# Output: 3.00000
# Explanation: All buckets already have the same amount of water in them.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= buckets.length <= 10‚Åµ 
#  0 <= buckets[i] <= 10‚Åµ 
#  0 <= loss <= 99
