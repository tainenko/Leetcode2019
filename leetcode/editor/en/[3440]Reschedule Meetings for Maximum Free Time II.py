# You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event. You are 
# also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n. 
# 
#  These represent the start and end times of n non-overlapping meetings that 
# occur during the event between time t = 0 and time t = eventTime, where the iᵗʰ 
# meeting occurs during the time [startTime[i], endTime[i]]. 
# 
#  You can reschedule at most one meeting by moving its start time while 
# maintaining the same duration, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to 
# maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event. 
# 
#  Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the 
# meetings. 
# 
#  Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event 
# and they should remain non-overlapping. 
# 
#  Note: In this version, it is valid for the relative ordering of the meetings 
# to change after rescheduling one meeting. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: eventTime = 5, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 2 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  Reschedule the meeting at [1, 2] to [2, 3], leaving no meetings during the 
# time [0, 2]. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,7,9], endTime = [1,8,10] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 7 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  Reschedule the meeting at [0, 1] to [8, 9], leaving no meetings during the 
# time [0, 7]. 
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,3,7,9], endTime = [1,4,8,10] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 6 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  Reschedule the meeting at [3, 4] to [8, 9], leaving no meetings during the 
# time [1, 7]. 
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
#  Input: eventTime = 5, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 0 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= eventTime <= 10⁹ 
#  n == startTime.length == endTime.length 
#  2 <= n <= 10⁵ 
#  0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime 
#  endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1] where i lies in the range [0, n - 2].
