# There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the 
# order of the letters is unknown to you. 
# 
#  You are given a list of strings words from the alien language's dictionary. 
# Now it is claimed that the strings in words are sorted lexicographically by the 
# rules of this new language. 
# 
#  If this claim is incorrect, and the given arrangement of string in words 
# cannot correspond to any order of letters, return "". 
# 
#  Otherwise, return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language 
# sorted in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules. If 
# there are multiple solutions, return any of them. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
# Output: "wertf"
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: words = ["z","x"]
# Output: "zx"
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
# Output: ""
# Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= words.length <= 100 
#  1 <= words[i].length <= 100 
#  words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
