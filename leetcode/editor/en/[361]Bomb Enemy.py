# Given an m x n matrix grid where each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' 
# or empty '0', return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can 
# only place the bomb in an empty cell. 
# 
#  The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted 
# point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]
# Output: 3
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [["W","W","W"],["0","0","0"],["E","E","E"]]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  m == grid.length 
#  n == grid[i].length 
#  1 <= m, n <= 500 
#  grid[i][j] is either 'W', 'E', or '0'.
