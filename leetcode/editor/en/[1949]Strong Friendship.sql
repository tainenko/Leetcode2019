#Table: Friendship 
#
# 
#+-------------+------+
#| Column Name | Type |
#+-------------+------+
#| user1_id    | int  |
#| user2_id    | int  |
#+-------------+------+
#(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
#Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are 
#friends.
#Note that user1_id < user2_id.
# 
#
# 
#
# A friendship between a pair of friends x and y is strong if x and y have at 
#least three common friends. 
#
# Write an SQL query to find all the strong friendships. 
#
# Note that the result table should not contain duplicates with user1_id < user2
#_id. 
#
# Return the result table in any order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Friendship table:
#+----------+----------+
#| user1_id | user2_id |
#+----------+----------+
#| 1        | 2        |
#| 1        | 3        |
#| 2        | 3        |
#| 1        | 4        |
#| 2        | 4        |
#| 1        | 5        |
#| 2        | 5        |
#| 1        | 7        |
#| 3        | 7        |
#| 1        | 6        |
#| 3        | 6        |
#| 2        | 6        |
#+----------+----------+
#Output: 
#+----------+----------+---------------+
#| user1_id | user2_id | common_friend |
#+----------+----------+---------------+
#| 1        | 2        | 4             |
#| 1        | 3        | 3             |
#+----------+----------+---------------+
#Explanation: 
#Users 1 and 2 have 4 common friends (3, 4, 5, and 6).
#Users 1 and 3 have 3 common friends (2, 6, and 7).
#We did not include the friendship of users 2 and 3 because they only have two 
#common friends (1 and 6).
