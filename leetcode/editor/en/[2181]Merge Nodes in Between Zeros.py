# You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers 
# separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 
# 0. 
# 
#  For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them 
# into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified 
# list should not contain any 0's. 
# 
#  Return the head of the modified linked list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
# Output: [4,11]
# Explanation: 
# The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
# - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
# - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
# Output: [1,3,4]
# Explanation: 
# The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
# - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
# - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
# - The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 10‚Åµ]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 1000 
#  There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0. 
#  The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.
