# Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree 
# with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them. 
# 
# 
#  A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every 
# node never differs by more than 1. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
# Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
# Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also 
# correct.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: [2,1,3]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#
