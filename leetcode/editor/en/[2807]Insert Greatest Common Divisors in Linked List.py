# Given the head of a linked list head, in which each node contains an integer 
# value. 
# 
#  Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal 
# to the greatest common divisor of them. 
# 
#  Return the linked list after insertion. 
# 
#  The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer 
# that evenly divides both numbers. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [18,6,10,3]
# Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]
# Explanation: The 1À¢·µó diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2‚Åø·µà 
# diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue are the 
# inserted nodes).
# - We insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1À¢·µó and 
# the 2‚Åø·µà nodes.
# - We insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2‚Åø·µà and 
# the 3 ≥·µà nodes.
# - We insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3 ≥·µà and 
# the 4·µó ∞ nodes.
# There are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [7]
# Output: [7]
# Explanation: The 1À¢·µó diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2‚Åø·µà 
# diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes.
# There are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so we return the initial linked list.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 1000
