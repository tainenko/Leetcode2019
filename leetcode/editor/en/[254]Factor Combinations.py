# Numbers can be regarded as the product of their factors. 
# 
#  
#  For example, 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 4. 
#  
# 
#  Given an integer n, return all possible combinations of its factors. You may 
# return the answer in any order. 
# 
#  Note that the factors should be in the range [2, n - 1]. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 1
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 12
# Output: [[2,6],[3,4],[2,2,3]]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 37
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 10⁷
