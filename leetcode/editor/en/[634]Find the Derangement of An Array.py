# In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements 
# of a set, such that no element appears in its original position. 
# 
#  You are given an integer n. There is originally an array consisting of n 
# integers from 1 to n in ascending order, return the number of derangements it can 
# generate. Since the answer may be huge, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] 
# and [3,1,2].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 2
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 10‚Å∂
