# You are given the head of a linked list. 
# 
#  Remove every node which has a node with a strictly greater value anywhere to 
# the right side of it. 
# 
#  Return the head of the modified linked list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
# Output: [13,8]
# Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
# - Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
# - Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
# - Node 8 is to the right of node 3.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
# Output: [1,1,1,1]
# Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
