# You are given a 2D integer array of student data students, where students[i] =
#  [student_id, bench_id] represents that student student_id is sitting on the 
# bench bench_id. 
# 
#  Return the maximum number of unique students sitting on any single bench. If 
# no students are present, return 0. 
# 
#  Note: A student can appear multiple times on the same bench in the input, 
# but they should be counted only once per bench. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: students = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,3],[1,3],[2,3]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 3 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  Bench 2 has two unique students: [1, 2]. 
#  Bench 3 has three unique students: [1, 2, 3]. 
#  The maximum number of unique students on a single bench is 3. 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: students = [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1],[4,2],[5,2]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 3 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  Bench 1 has three unique students: [1, 2, 3]. 
#  Bench 2 has two unique students: [4, 5]. 
#  The maximum number of unique students on a single bench is 3. 
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: students = [[1,1],[1,1]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 1 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  The maximum number of unique students on a single bench is 1. 
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
#  Input: students = [] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 0 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  Since no students are present, the output is 0. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  0 <= students.length <= 100 
#  students[i] = [student_id, bench_id] 
#  1 <= student_id <= 100 
#  1 <= bench_id <= 100
