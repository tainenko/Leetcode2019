# You are given a m x n matrix grid consisting of non-negative integers. 
# 
#  In one operation, you can increment the value of any grid[i][j] by 1. 
# 
#  Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all columns of grid 
# strictly increasing. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,1]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 15 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  To make the 0·µó ∞ column strictly increasing, we can apply 3 operations on 
# grid[1][0], 2 operations on grid[2][0], and 6 operations on grid[3][0]. 
#  To make the 1À¢·µó column strictly increasing, we can apply 4 operations on 
# grid[3][1]. 
#  
# 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[2,1,0],[1,2,3]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 12 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  To make the 0·µó ∞ column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on 
# grid[1][0], and 4 operations on grid[2][0]. 
#  To make the 1À¢·µó column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on 
# grid[1][1], and 2 operations on grid[2][1]. 
#  To make the 2‚Åø·µà column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on 
# grid[1][2]. 
#  
# 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  m == grid.length 
#  n == grid[i].length 
#  1 <= m, n <= 50 
#  0 <= grid[i][j] < 2500
