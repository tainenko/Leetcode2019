# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an 
# integer k. 
# 
#  Your task is to construct a new string that contains only those characters 
# from s which appear fewer than k times in the entire string. The order of 
# characters in the new string must be the same as their order in s. 
# 
#  Return the resulting string. If no characters qualify, return an empty 
# string. 
# 
#  Note: Every occurrence of a character that occurs fewer than k times is kept.
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: s = "aadbbcccca", k = 3 
#  
# 
#  Output: "dbb" 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  Character frequencies in s: 
# 
#  
#  'a' appears 3 times 
#  'd' appears 1 time 
#  'b' appears 2 times 
#  'c' appears 4 times 
#  
# 
#  Only 'd' and 'b' appear fewer than 3 times. Preserving their order, the 
# result is "dbb". 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: s = "xyz", k = 2 
#  
# 
#  Output: "xyz" 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  All characters ('x', 'y', 'z') appear exactly once, which is fewer than 2. 
# Thus the whole string is returned. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length <= 100 
#  s consists of lowercase English letters. 
#  1 <= k <= s.length
