# You are given an integer array order of length n and an integer array friends.
#  
# 
#  
#  order contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, representing the IDs 
# of the participants of a race in their finishing order. 
#  friends contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly 
# increasing order. Each ID in friends is guaranteed to appear in the order array. 
#  
# 
#  Return an array containing your friends' IDs in their finishing order. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: order = [3,1,2,5,4], friends = [1,3,4] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [3,1,4] 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  The finishing order is [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]. Therefore, the finishing order of 
# your friends is [3, 1, 4]. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: order = [1,4,5,3,2], friends = [2,5] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [5,2] 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  The finishing order is [1, 4, 5, 3, 2]. Therefore, the finishing order of 
# your friends is [5, 2]. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n == order.length <= 100 
#  order contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once 
#  1 <= friends.length <= min(8, n) 
#  1 <= friends[i] <= n 
#  friends is strictly increasing
