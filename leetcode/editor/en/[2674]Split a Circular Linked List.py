# Given a circular linked list list of positive integers, your task is to split 
# it into 2 circular linked lists so that the first one contains the first half 
# of the nodes in list (exactly ceil(list.length / 2) nodes) in the same order they 
# appeared in list, and the second one contains the rest of the nodes in list in 
# the same order they appeared in list. 
# 
#  Return an array answer of length 2 in which the first element is a circular 
# linked list representing the first half and the second element is a circular 
# linked list representing the second half. 
# 
#  
#  A 
#  circular linked list is a normal linked list with the only difference being 
# that the last node's next node, is the first node.
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,5,7]
# Output: [[1,5],[7]]
# Explanation: The initial list has 3 nodes so the first half would be the 
# first 2 elements since ceil(3 / 2) = 2 and the rest which is 1 node is in the second 
# half.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [2,6,1,5]
# Output: [[2,6],[1,5]]
# Explanation: The initial list has 4 nodes so the first half would be the 
# first 2 elements since ceil(4 / 2) = 2 and the rest which is 2 nodes are in the 
# second half.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in list is in the range [2, 10‚Åµ] 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  LastNode.next = FirstNode where LastNode is the last node of the list and 
# FirstNode is the first one
