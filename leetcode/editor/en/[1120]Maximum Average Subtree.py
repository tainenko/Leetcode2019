# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum average value of a 
# subtree of that tree. Answers within 10‚Åª‚Åµ of the actual answer will be accepted. 
# 
#  A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. 
# 
#  The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number 
# of nodes. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [5,6,1]
# Output: 6.00000
# Explanation: 
# For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
# For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
# For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
# So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [0,null,1]
# Output: 1.00000
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
