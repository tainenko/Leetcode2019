# You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix grid. The width of a column is 
# the maximum length of its integers. 
# 
#  
#  For example, if grid = [[-10], [3], [12]], the width of the only column is 3 
# since -10 is of length 3. 
#  
# 
#  Return an integer array ans of size n where ans[i] is the width of the i·µó ∞ 
# column. 
# 
#  The length of an integer x with len digits is equal to len if x is non-
# negative, and len + 1 otherwise. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [[1],[22],[333]]
# Output: [3]
# Explanation: In the 0·µó ∞ column, 333 is of length 3.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: grid = [[-15,1,3],[15,7,12],[5,6,-2]]
# Output: [3,1,2]
# Explanation: 
# In the 0·µó ∞ column, only -15 is of length 3.
# In the 1À¢·µó column, all integers are of length 1. 
# In the 2‚Åø·µà column, both 12 and -2 are of length 2.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  m == grid.length 
#  n == grid[i].length 
#  1 <= m, n <= 100 
#  -10‚Åπ <= grid[r][c] <= 10‚Åπ
