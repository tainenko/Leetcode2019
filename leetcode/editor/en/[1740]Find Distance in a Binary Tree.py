# Given the root of a binary tree and two integers p and q, return the distance 
# between the nodes of value p and value q in the tree. 
# 
#  The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the path from one 
# to the other. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 0
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are 3 edges between 5 and 0: 5-3-1-0. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 7
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 edges between 5 and 7: 5-2-7. 
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 5
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The distance between a node and itself is 0. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  p and q are values in the tree.
