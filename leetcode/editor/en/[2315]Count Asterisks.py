# You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are 
# grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1À¢·µó and 2‚Åø·µà '|' make a pair, the 3 ≥·µà and 
# 4·µó ∞ '|' make a pair, and so forth. 
# 
#  Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'. 
# 
#  Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
# The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
# Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the 
# answer.
# There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "iamprogrammer"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we 
# return 0.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|
# tifu|l". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length <= 1000 
#  s consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars '|', and asterisks '*
# '. 
#  s contains an even number of vertical bars '|'.
