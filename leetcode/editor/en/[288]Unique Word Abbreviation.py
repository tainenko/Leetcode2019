# The abbreviation of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number 
# of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word 
# has only two characters, then it is an abbreviation of itself. 
# 
#  For example: 
# 
#  
#  dog --> d1g because there is one letter between the first letter 'd' and the 
# last letter 'g'. 
#  internationalization --> i18n because there are 18 letters between the first 
# letter 'i' and the last letter 'n'. 
#  it --> it because any word with only two characters is an abbreviation of 
# itself. 
#  
# 
#  Implement the ValidWordAbbr class: 
# 
#  
#  ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary) Initializes the object with a dictionary 
# of words. 
#  boolean isUnique(string word) Returns true if either of the following 
# conditions are met (otherwise returns false): 
#  
#  There is no word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
# abbreviation. 
#  For any word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
# abbreviation, that word and word are the same. 
#  
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input
# ["ValidWordAbbr", "isUnique", "isUnique", "isUnique", "isUnique", "isUnique"]
# [[["deer", "door", "cake", "card"]], ["dear"], ["cart"], ["cane"], ["make"], [
# "cake"]]
# Output
# [null, false, true, false, true, true]
# 
# Explanation
# ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(["deer", "door", "cake", 
# "card"]);
# validWordAbbr.isUnique("dear"); // return false, dictionary word "deer" and 
# word "dear" have the same abbreviation "d2r" but are not the same.
# validWordAbbr.isUnique("cart"); // return true, no words in the dictionary 
# have the abbreviation "c2t".
# validWordAbbr.isUnique("cane"); // return false, dictionary word "cake" and 
# word "cane" have the same abbreviation  "c2e" but are not the same.
# validWordAbbr.isUnique("make"); // return true, no words in the dictionary 
# have the abbreviation "m2e".
# validWordAbbr.isUnique("cake"); // return true, because "cake" is already in 
# the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has "c2e" abbreviation.
#

#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= dictionary.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
#  1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 20 
#  dictionary[i] consists of lowercase English letters. 
#  1 <= word.length <= 20 
#  word consists of lowercase English letters.
