# You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is exactly one invalid node 
# where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the same depth but 
# to the invalid node's right. 
# 
#  Given the root of the binary tree with this defect, root, return the root of 
# the binary tree after removing this invalid node and every node underneath it (
# minus the node it incorrectly points to). 
# 
#  Custom testing: 
# 
#  The test input is read as 3 lines: 
# 
#  
#  TreeNode root 
#  int fromNode (not available to correctBinaryTree) 
#  int toNode (not available to correctBinaryTree) 
#  
# 
#  After the binary tree rooted at root is parsed, the TreeNode with value of 
# fromNode will have its right child pointer pointing to the TreeNode with a value 
# of toNode. Then, root is passed to correctBinaryTree. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3], fromNode = 2, toNode = 3
# Output: [1,null,3]
# Explanation: The node with value 2 is invalid, so remove it.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
# Input: root = [8,3,1,7,null,9,4,2,null,null,null,5,6], fromNode = 7, toNode = 
# 4
# Output: [8,3,1,null,null,9,4,null,null,5,6]
# Explanation: The node with value 7 is invalid, so remove it and the node 
# underneath it, node 2.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [3, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  fromNode != toNode 
#  fromNode and toNode will exist in the tree and will be on the same depth. 
#  toNode is to the right of fromNode. 
#  fromNode.right is null in the initial tree from the test data.
