# Leetcode Bank (LCB) helps its coders in making virtual payments. Our bank 
#records all transactions in the table Transaction, we want to find out the current 
#balance of all users and check whether they have breached their credit limit (If 
#their current credit is less than 0). 
#
# Write an SQL query to report. 
#
# 
# user_id, 
# user_name, 
# credit, current balance after performing transactions, and 
# credit_limit_breached, check credit_limit ("Yes" or "No") 
# 
#
# Return the result table in any order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Users table:
#+------------+--------------+-------------+
#| user_id    | user_name    | credit      |
#+------------+--------------+-------------+
#| 1          | Moustafa     | 100         |
#| 2          | Jonathan     | 200         |
#| 3          | Winston      | 10000       |
#| 4          | Luis         | 800         |

#| 1          | 1          | 3          | 400      | 2020-08-01    |

#Output: 
#+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
#| user_id    | user_name  | credit     | credit_limit_breached |
#+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
#| 1          | Moustafa   | -100       | Yes                   |

#Explanation: 
#Moustafa paid $400 on "2020-08-01" and received $200 on "2020-08-03", credit (1
#00 -400 +200) = -$100
#Jonathan received $500 on "2020-08-02" and paid $200 on "2020-08-08", credit (2
#00 +500 -200) = $500
#Winston received $400 on "2020-08-01" and paid $500 on "2020-08-03", credit (10
#000 +400 -500) = $9990
#Luis did not received any transfer, credit = $800
