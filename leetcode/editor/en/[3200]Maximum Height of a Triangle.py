# You are given two integers red and blue representing the count of red and 
# blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that 
# the 1À¢·µó row will have 1 ball, the 2‚Åø·µà row will have 2 balls, the 3 ≥·µà row will have 
# 3 balls, and so on. 
# 
#  All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent 
# rows should have different colors. 
# 
#  Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: red = 2, blue = 4 
#  
# 
#  Output: 3 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  The only possible arrangement is shown above.

#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: red = 2, blue = 1 
#  
# 
#  Output: 2
