# Given the root of a binary tree and a leaf node, reroot the tree so that the 
# leaf is the new root. 
# 
#  You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node cur on the 
# path starting from the leaf up to the root excluding the root: 
# 
#  
#  If cur has a left child, then that child becomes cur's right child. 
#  cur's original parent becomes cur's left child. Note that in this process 
# the original parent's pointer to cur becomes null, making it have at most one 
# child. 
#  
# 
#  Return the new root of the rerooted tree. 
# 
#  Note: Ensure that your solution sets the Node.parent pointers correctly 
# after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer". 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 7
# Output: [7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 0
# Output: [0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100]. 
#  -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  leaf exist in the tree.
