# You are given an integer array nums. 
# 
#  Return the smallest index i such that the sum of the digits of nums[i] is 
# equal to i. 
# 
#  If no such index exists, return -1. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,3,2] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 2 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  For nums[2] = 2, the sum of digits is 2, which is equal to index i = 2. Thus,
#  the output is 2. 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,10,11] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 1 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  For nums[1] = 10, the sum of digits is 1 + 0 = 1, which is equal to index i =
#  1. 
#  For nums[2] = 11, the sum of digits is 1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to index i =
#  2. 
#  Since index 1 is the smallest, the output is 1. 
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,2,3] 
#  
# 
#  Output: -1 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  Since no index satisfies the condition, the output is -1. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 100 
#  0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
