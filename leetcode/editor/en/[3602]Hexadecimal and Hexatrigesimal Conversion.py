# You are given an integer n. 
# 
#  Return the concatenation of the hexadecimal representation of n² and the 
# hexatrigesimal representation of n³. 
# 
#  A hexadecimal number is defined as a base-16 numeral system that uses the 
# digits 0 – 9 and the uppercase letters A - F to represent values from 0 to 15. 
# 
#  A hexatrigesimal number is defined as a base-36 numeral system that uses the 
# digits 0 – 9 and the uppercase letters A - Z to represent values from 0 to 35. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: n = 13 
#  
# 
#  Output: "A91P1" 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  n² = 13 * 13 = 169. In hexadecimal, it converts to (10 * 16) + 9 = 169, 
# which corresponds to "A9". 
#  n³ = 13 * 13 * 13 = 2197. In hexatrigesimal, it converts to (1 * 36²) + (25 *
#  36) + 1 = 2197, which corresponds to "1P1". 
#  Concatenating both results gives "A9" + "1P1" = "A91P1". 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: n = 36 
#  
# 
#  Output: "5101000" 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  n² = 36 * 36 = 1296. In hexadecimal, it converts to (5 * 16²) + (1 * 16) + 0 
# = 1296, which corresponds to "510". 
#  n³ = 36 * 36 * 36 = 46656. In hexatrigesimal, it converts to (1 * 36³) + (0 *
#  36²) + (0 * 36) + 0 = 46656, which corresponds to "1000". 
#  Concatenating both results gives "510" + "1000" = "5101000". 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 1000
