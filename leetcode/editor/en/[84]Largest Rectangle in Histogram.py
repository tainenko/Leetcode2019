# Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height 
# where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the 
# histogram. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
# The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: heights = [2,4]
# Output: 4
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= heights.length <= 10⁵ 
#  0 <= heights[i] <= 10⁴
