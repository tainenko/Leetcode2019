#Table: Experiments 
#
# 
#+-----------------+------+
#| Column Name     | Type |
#+-----------------+------+
#| experiment_id   | int  |
#| platform        | enum |
#| experiment_name | enum |
#+-----------------+------+
#experiment_id is the primary key for this table.
#platform is an enum with one of the values ('Android', 'IOS', 'Web').
#experiment_name is an enum with one of the values ('Reading', 'Sports', 
#'Programming').
#This table contains information about the ID of an experiment done with a 
#random person, the platform used to do the experiment, and the name of the 
#experiment.
# 
#
# 
#
# Write an SQL query to report the number of experiments done on each of the 
#three platforms for each of the three given experiments. Notice that all the pairs 
#of (platform, experiment) should be included in the output including the pairs 
#with zero experiments. 
#
# Return the result table in any order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#

#Input:
#Experiments table:
#+---------------+----------+-----------------+
#| experiment_id | platform | experiment_name |

#Output:

#Explanation: 
#On the platform "Android", we had only one "Reading" experiment.
#On the platform "IOS", we had one "Sports" experiment and one "Programming" 
#experiment.
#On the platform "Web", we had two "Reading" experiments and one "Programming" 
#experiment.
