# There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. 
# A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges 
# that connect the center node with every other node. 
# 
#  You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] 
# indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the 
# given star graph. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other 
# node, so 2 is the center.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  3 <= n <= 10⁵ 
#  edges.length == n - 1 
#  edges[i].length == 2 
#  1 <= ui, vi <= n 
#  ui != vi 
#  The given edges represent a valid star graph.
