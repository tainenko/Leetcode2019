# You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can 
# visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the 
# history number of steps. 
# 
#  Implement the BrowserHistory class: 
# 
#  
#  BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of 
# the browser. 
#  void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all 
# the forward history. 
#  string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x 
# steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the 
# current url after moving back in history at most steps. 
#  string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only 
# forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return 
# the current url after forwarding in history at most steps. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Input:
# ["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit",
# "forward","back","back"]
# [["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],
# ["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]
# Output:
# [null,null,null,null,"facebook.com","google.com","facebook.com",null,
# "linkedin.com","google.com","leetcode.com"]
# 
# Explanation:
# BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
# browserHistory.visit("google.com");       // You are in "leetcode.com". Visit 
# "google.com"
# browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");     // You are in "google.com". Visit 
# "facebook.com"
# browserHistory.visit("youtube.com");      // You are in "facebook.com". Visit 
# "youtube.com"
# browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "youtube.com", move 
# back to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
# browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "facebook.com", move 
# back to "google.com" return "google.com"
# browserHistory.forward(1);                // You are in "google.com", move 
# forward to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
# browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");     // You are in "facebook.com". Visit 
# "linkedin.com"
# browserHistory.forward(2);                // You are in "linkedin.com", you 
# cannot move forward any steps.
# browserHistory.back(2);                   // You are in "linkedin.com", move 
# back two steps to "facebook.com" then to "google.com". return "google.com"
# browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can 
# move back only one step to "leetcode.com". return "leetcode.com"
#

#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= homepage.length <= 20 
#  1 <= url.length <= 20 
#  1 <= steps <= 100 
#  homepage and url consist of '.' or lower case English letters. 
#  At most 5000 calls will be made to visit, back, and forward.
