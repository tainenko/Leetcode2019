# You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of 
# students in a university. You would like to enter all these students into a 
# competition in ordered non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following 
# conditions: 
# 
#  
#  The sum of the grades of students in the i·µó ∞ group is less than the sum of 
# the grades of students in the (i + 1)·µó ∞ group, for all groups (except the last). 
#  The total number of students in the i·µó ∞ group is less than the total number 
# of students in the (i + 1)·µó ∞ group, for all groups (except the last). 
#  
# 
#  Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:
# - 1À¢·µó group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student 
# count: 1
# - 2‚Åø·µà group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. 
# Student count: 2
# - 3 ≥·µà group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5
#  = 18. Student count: 3
# It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: grades = [8,8]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We can only form 1 group, since forming 2 groups would lead to 
# an equal number of students in both groups.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= grades.length <= 10‚Åµ 
#  1 <= grades[i] <= 10‚Åµ
