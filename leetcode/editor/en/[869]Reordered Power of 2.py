# You are given an integer n. We reorder the digits in any order (including the 
# original order) such that the leading digit is not zero. 
# 
#  Return true if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a 
# power of two. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 10
# Output: false
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 10⁹
