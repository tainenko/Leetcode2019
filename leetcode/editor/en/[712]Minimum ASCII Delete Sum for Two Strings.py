# Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted 
# characters to make two strings equal. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
# Output: 231
# Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the 
# sum.
# Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
# At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum 
# possible to achieve this.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
# Output: 403
# Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
# adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
# Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
# At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101
#  = 403.
# If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers 
# of 433 or 417, which are higher.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000 
#  s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
