# You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values. 
# 
#  In one operation, you can choose any two nodes at the same level and swap 
# their values. 
# 
#  Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each 
# level sorted in a strictly increasing order. 
# 
#  The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the 
# root node. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# - Swap 4 and 3. The 2‚Åø·µà level becomes [3,4].
# - Swap 7 and 5. The 3 ≥·µà level becomes [5,6,8,7].
# - Swap 8 and 7. The 3 ≥·µà level becomes [5,6,7,8].
# We used 3 operations so return 3.
# It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# - Swap 3 and 2. The 2‚Åø·µà level becomes [2,3].
# - Swap 7 and 4. The 3 ≥·µà level becomes [4,6,5,7].
# - Swap 6 and 5. The 3 ≥·µà level becomes [4,5,6,7].
# We used 3 operations so return 3.
# It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Each level is already sorted in increasing order so return 0.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  All the values of the tree are unique.
