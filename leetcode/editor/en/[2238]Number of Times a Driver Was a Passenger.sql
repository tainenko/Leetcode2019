#Table: Rides 
#
# 
#+--------------+------+
#| Column Name  | Type |
#+--------------+------+
#| ride_id      | int  |
#| driver_id    | int  |
#| passenger_id | int  |
#+--------------+------+
#ride_id is the primary key for this table.
#Each row of this table contains the ID of the driver and the ID of the 
#passenger that rode in ride_id.
#Note that driver_id != passenger_id.
# 
#
# 
#
# Write an SQL query to report the ID of each driver and the number of times 
#they were a passenger. 
#
# Return the result table in any order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Rides table:
#+---------+-----------+--------------+
#| ride_id | driver_id | passenger_id |
#+---------+-----------+--------------+
#| 1       | 7         | 1            |
#| 2       | 7         | 2            |
#| 3       | 11        | 1            |
#| 4       | 11        | 7            |
#| 5       | 11        | 7            |
#| 6       | 11        | 3            |
#+---------+-----------+--------------+
#Output: 
#+-----------+-----+
#| driver_id | cnt |
#+-----------+-----+
#| 7         | 2   |
#| 11        | 0   |
#+-----------+-----+
#Explanation: 
#There are two drivers in all the given rides: 7 and 11.
#The driver with ID = 7 was a passenger two times.
#The driver with ID = 11 was never a passenger.
