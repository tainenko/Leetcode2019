# Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in non-descending order, 
# write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a 
# sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in 
# the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list. 
# 
#  If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any 
# place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain 
# sorted. 
# 
#  If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), you should create a new 
# single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, 
# you should return the originally given node. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
# Output: [3,4,1,2]
# Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three 
# elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to 
# insert 2 into the list. The new node should be inserted between node 1 and node 3. 
# After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return 
# node 3.
#  
# 
# 
# 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The list is empty (given head is¬†null). We create a new single 
# circular list and return the reference to that single node.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
# Output: [1,0]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Å∂ <= Node.val, insertVal <= 10‚Å∂
