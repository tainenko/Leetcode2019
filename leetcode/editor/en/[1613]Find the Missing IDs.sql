#Table: Customers 
#
# 
#+---------------+---------+
#| Column Name   | Type    |
#+---------------+---------+
#| customer_id   | int     |
#| customer_name | varchar |
#+---------------+---------+
#customer_id is the primary key for this table.
#Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
# 
#
# 
#
# Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones 
#that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the 
#maximum customer_id present in the table. 
#
# Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100. 
#
# Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Customers table:
#+-------------+---------------+
#| customer_id | customer_name |
#+-------------+---------------+
#| 1           | Alice         |
#| 4           | Bob           |
#| 5           | Charlie       |
#+-------------+---------------+
#Output: 
#+-----+
#| ids |
#+-----+
#| 2   |
#| 3   |
#+-----+
#Explanation: 
#The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2
# and 3 are missing from the table.
