# Write an SQL query to find the average daily percentage of posts that got 
#removed after being reported as spam, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example.

#| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
#| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |

#Removals table:
#+---------+-------------+
#| post_id | remove_date |
#+---------+-------------+
#| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
#| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
#+---------+-------------+
#Output: 
#+-----------------------+
#| average_daily_percent |
#+-----------------------+
#| 75.00                 |
#+-----------------------+
#Explanation: 
#The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam 
#reported posts were removed.
#The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam 
#and it was removed.
#The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
#Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the 
#remove dates.
