#Table: Accounts 
#
# 
#+-------------+------+
#| Column Name | Type |
#+-------------+------+
#| account_id  | int  |
#| income      | int  |
#+-------------+------+
#In SQL, account_id is the primary key for this table.
#Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
# 
#
# 
#
# Calculate the number of bank accounts of each salary category. The salary 
#categories are: 
#
# 
# "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000. 
# "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000]. 
# "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000. 
# 
#
# The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts 
#in a category, return 0. 
#
# Return the result table in any order. 
#
# The result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Accounts table:
#+------------+--------+
#| account_id | income |
#+------------+--------+
#| 3          | 108939 |

#| 8          | 87709  |
#| 6          | 91796  |
