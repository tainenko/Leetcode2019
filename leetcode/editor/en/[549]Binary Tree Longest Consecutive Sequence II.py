# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest consecutive 
# path in the tree. 
# 
#  A consecutive path is a path where the values of the consecutive nodes in 
# the path differ by one. This path can be either increasing or decreasing. 
# 
#  
#  For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path 
# [1,2,4,3] is not valid. 
#  
# 
#  On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where 
# not necessarily be parent-child order. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -3 * 10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 3 * 10‚Å¥
