# You are given an object street of class Street that represents a circular 
# street and a positive integer k which represents a maximum bound for the number of 
# houses in that street (in other words, the number of houses is less than or 
# equal to k). Houses' doors could be open or closed initially. 
# 
#  Initially, you are standing in front of a door to a house on this street. 
# Your task is to count the number of houses in the street. 
# 
#  The class Street contains the following functions which may help you: 
# 
#  
#  void openDoor(): Open the door of the house you are in front of. 
#  void closeDoor(): Close the door of the house you are in front of. 
#  boolean isDoorOpen(): Returns true if the door of the current house is open 
# and false otherwise. 
#  void moveRight(): Move to the right house. 
#  void moveLeft(): Move to the left house. 
#  
# 
#  Return ans which represents the number of houses on this street. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: street = [0,0,0,0], k = 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 houses, and all their doors are closed. 
# The number of houses is less than k, which is 10. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: street = [1,0,1,1,0], k = 5
# Output: 5
# Explanation: There are 5 houses, and the doors of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th house 
# (moving in the right direction) are open, and the rest are closed.
# The number of houses is equal to k, which is 5.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  n == number of houses 
#  1 <= n <= k <= 10³
