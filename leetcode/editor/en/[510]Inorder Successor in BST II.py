# Given a node in a binary search tree, return the in-order successor of that 
# node in the BST. If that node has no in-order successor, return null. 
# 
#  The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than node.
# val. 
# 
#  You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. 
# Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for 
# Node: 
# 
#  
# class Node {
#     public int val;
#     public Node left;
#     public Node right;
#     public Node parent;
# }
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node and 
# the return value is of Node type.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
# Output: null
# Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the 
# answer is null.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  All Nodes will have unique values. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Could you solve it without looking up any of the node's values?
