# Given the root of a binary tree root where each node has a value, return the 
# level of the tree that has the minimum sum of values among all the levels (in 
# case of a tie, return the lowest level). 
# 
#  Note that the root of the tree is at level 1 and the level of any other node 
# is its distance from the root + 1. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: root = [50,6,2,30,80,7] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 2 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: root = [36,17,10,null,null,24] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 3 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: root = [5,null,5,null,5] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 1 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ
