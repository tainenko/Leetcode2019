# Suppose we have a class: 
# 
#  
# public class Foo {
#   public void first() { print("first"); }
#   public void second() { print("second"); }
#   public void third() { print("third"); }
# }
#  
# 
#  The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A 
# will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). 
# Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed af
# ter first(), and third() is executed after second(). 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, eve
# n though the numbers in the input seem to imply the ordering. The input format y
# ou see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: "firstsecondthird"
# Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,
# 2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls t
# hird(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,3,2]
# Output: "firstsecondthird"
# Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls th
# ird(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
