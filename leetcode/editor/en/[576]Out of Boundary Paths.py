# There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the b
# all, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four d
# irections (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N times. Find o
# ut the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be 
# very large, return it after mod 109 + 7. 
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
# Output: 12
# Explanation:
# 
#  
# 
#  
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back. 
#  The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50]. 
#  N is in range [0,50].
