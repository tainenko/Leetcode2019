# Given the head of a linked list, find all the values that appear more than 
# once in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values. 
# 
#  Return the linked list after the deletions. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted.
#  After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [2,1,1,2]
# Output: []
# Explanation: 2 and 1 both appear twice. All the elements should be deleted.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [3,2,2,1,3,2,4]
# Output: [1,4]
# Explanation: 3 appears twice and 2 appears three times. After deleting all 3
# 's and 2's, we are left with [1,4].
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ] 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#
