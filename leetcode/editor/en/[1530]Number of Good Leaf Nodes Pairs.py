# You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance. A pair of 
# two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of the 
# shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance. 
# 
#  Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the 
# shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The 
# pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2], distance = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The only good pair is [2,5].
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2¬π‚Å∞]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 100 
#  1 <= distance <= 10
