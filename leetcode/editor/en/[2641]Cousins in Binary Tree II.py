# Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree 
# with the sum of all its cousins' values. 
# 
#  Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with 
# different parents. 
# 
#  Return the root of the modified tree. 
# 
#  Note that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the 
# root node to it. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
# Output: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
# Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary 
# tree after changing the value of each node.
# - Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
# - Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
# - Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,1,2]
# Output: [0,0,0]
# Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary 
# tree after changing the value of each node.
# - Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
