# You are given an integer array nums containing positive integers. We define a 
# function encrypt such that encrypt(x) replaces every digit in x with the 
# largest digit in x. For example, encrypt(523) = 555 and encrypt(213) = 333. 
# 
#  Return the sum of encrypted elements. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,2,3] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 6 
# 
#  Explanation: The encrypted elements are [1,2,3]. The sum of encrypted 
# elements is 1 + 2 + 3 == 6. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [10,21,31] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 66 
# 
#  Explanation: The encrypted elements are [11,22,33]. The sum of encrypted 
# elements is 11 + 22 + 33 == 66. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 50 
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
