#Table: Flights 
#
# 
#+-------------+------+
#| Column Name | Type |
#+-------------+------+
#| flight_id   | int  |
#| capacity    | int  |
#+-------------+------+
#flight_id is the primary key column for this table.
#Each row of this table contains flight id and its capacity.
#

# Table: Passengers 
#
# 
#+--------------+------+
#| Column Name  | Type |
#+--------------+------+
#| passenger_id | int  |
#| flight_id    | int  |
#+--------------+------+
#passenger_id is the primary key column for this table.
#Each row of this table contains passenger id and flight id.
# 
#
# Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a passenger books a ticket 
#for a flight and there are still empty seats available on the flight, the 
#passenger ticket will be confirmed. However, the passenger will be on a waitlist if 
#the flight is already at full capacity. 
#
# Write an SQL query to report the number of passengers who successfully booked 
#a flight (got a seat) and the number of passengers who are on the waitlist for 
#each flight. 
#
# Return the result table ordered by flight_id in ascending order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Flights table:
#+-----------+----------+
#| flight_id | capacity |
#+-----------+----------+
#| 1         | 2        |
#| 2         | 2        |
#| 3         | 1        |
#+-----------+----------+
#Passengers table:
#+--------------+-----------+
#| passenger_id | flight_id |
#+--------------+-----------+
#| 101          | 1         |
#| 102          | 1         |
#| 103          | 1         |
#| 104          | 2         |
#| 105          | 2         |
#| 106          | 3         |
#| 107          | 3         |
#+--------------+-----------+
#Output: 
#+-----------+------------+--------------+
#| flight_id | booked_cnt | waitlist_cnt |
#+-----------+------------+--------------+
#| 1         | 2          | 1            |
#| 2         | 2          | 0            |
#| 3         | 1          | 1            |

#Explanation: 
#- Flight 1 has a capacity of 2. As there are 3 passengers who have booked 
#tickets, only 2 passengers can get a seat. Therefore, 2 passengers are successfully 
#booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
#- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2. Since there are exactly 2 passengers who 
#booked tickets, everyone can secure a seat. As a result, 2 passengers successfully 
#booked their seats and there are no passengers on the waitlist.
#- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1. As there are 2 passengers who have booked 
#tickets, only 1 passenger can get a seat. Therefore, 1 passenger is successfully 
#booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
