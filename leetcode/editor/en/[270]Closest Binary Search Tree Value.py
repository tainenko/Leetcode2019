# Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value 
# in the BST that is closest to the target. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
# Output: 4
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1], target = 4.428571
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  -10‚Åπ <= target <= 10‚Åπ
