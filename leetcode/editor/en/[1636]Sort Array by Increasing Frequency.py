# Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on 
# the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort 
# them in decreasing order. 
# 
#  Return the sorted array. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
# Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
# Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has 
# a frequency of 3.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
# Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
# Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in 
# decreasing order.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
# Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1] 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 100 
#  -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
