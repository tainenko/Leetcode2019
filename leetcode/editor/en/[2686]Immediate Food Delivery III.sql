#Table: Delivery

#+-----------------------------+---------+
#| Column Name                 | Type    |
#+-----------------------------+---------+
#| delivery_id                 | int     |
#| customer_id                 | int     |
#| order_date                  | date    |
#| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
#+-----------------------------+---------+
#delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
#Each row contains information about food delivery to a customer that makes an 
#order at some date and specifies a preferred delivery date (on the order date or 
#after it).
# 
#
# If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then 
#the order is called immediate, otherwise, it is scheduled. 
#
# Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders on each unique 
#order_date, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
#
# Return the result table ordered by order_date in ascending order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example.

#| order_date | immediate_percentage |

#Explanation: 
#- On 2019-08-01 there were three orders, out of those, two were immediate and 
#one was scheduled. So, immediate percentage for that date was 66.67.
#- On 2019-08-02 there were three orders, out of those, two were immediate and 
#one was scheduled. So, immediate percentage for that date was 66.67.
#- On 2019-08-03 there were two orders, both were immediate. So, the immediate 
#percentage for that date was 100.00.
#- On 2019-08-04 there were two orders, both were scheduled. So, the immediate 
#percentage for that date was 0.00.
#order_date is sorted in ascending order.
