#Table: Spotify 
#
# 
#+-------------+---------+ 
#| Column Name | Type    | 
#+-------------+---------+ 
#| id          | int     | 
#| track_name  | varchar |
#| artist      | varchar |
#+-------------+---------+
#id is the primary Key for this table.
#Each row contains an id, track_name, and artist.
# 
#
# Write an SQL query to find how many times each artist appeared on the spotify 
#ranking list. 
#
# Return the result table having the artist's name along with the corresponding 
#number of occurrences ordered by occurrence count in descending order. If the 
#occurrences are equal, then it‚Äôs ordered by the artist‚Äôs name in ascending order. 
#
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input:
#Spotify table: 
#+---------+--------------------+------------+ 
#| id      | track_name         | artist     |

#| Ed Sheeran | 2           |
#| Sia        | 1           |
