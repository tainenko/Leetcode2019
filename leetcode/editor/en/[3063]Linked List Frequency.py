# Given the head of a linked list containing k distinct elements, return the 
# head to a linked list of length k containing the frequency of each distinct 
# element in the given linked list in any order. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: head = [1,1,2,1,2,3] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [3,2,1] 
# 
#  Explanation: There are 3 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of 1 
# is 3, the frequency of 2 is 2 and the frequency of 3 is 1. Hence, we return 3 -> 2
#  -> 1. 
# 
#  Note that 1 -> 2 -> 3, 1 -> 3 -> 2, 2 -> 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3 -> 1, and 3 -> 1 -> 2
#  are also valid answers. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: head = [1,1,2,2,2] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [2,3] 
# 
#  Explanation: There are 2 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of 1 
# is 2 and the frequency of 2 is 3. Hence, we return 2 -> 3. 
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: head = [6,5,4,3,2,1] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [1,1,1,1,1,1] 
# 
#  Explanation: There are 6 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of 
# each of them is 1. Hence, we return 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
