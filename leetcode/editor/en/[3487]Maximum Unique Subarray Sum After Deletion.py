# You are given an integer array nums. 
# 
#  You are allowed to delete any number of elements from nums without making it 
# empty. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of nums such that: 
# 
#  
#  All elements in the subarray are unique. 
#  The sum of the elements in the subarray is maximized. 
#  
# 
#  Return the maximum sum of such a subarray. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 15 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  Select the entire array without deleting any element to obtain the maximum 
# sum. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 1 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  Delete the element nums[0] == 1, nums[1] == 1, nums[2] == 0, and nums[3] == 1
# . Select the entire array [1] to obtain the maximum sum. 
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,2,-1,-2,1,0,-1] 
#  
# 
#  Output: 3 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  Delete the elements nums[2] == -1 and nums[3] == -2, and select the subarray 
# [2, 1] from [1, 2, 1, 0, -1] to obtain the maximum sum. 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 100 
#  -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
