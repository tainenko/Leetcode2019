# Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest i
# ntegers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. 
# 
# 
#  An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if: 
# 
#  
#  |a - x| < |b - x|, or 
#  |a - x| == |b - x| and a < b 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
#  
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= k <= arr.length 
#  1 <= arr.length <= 104 
#  arr is sorted in ascending order. 
#  -104 <= arr[i], x <= 104
