# You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score 
# of the i·µó ∞ athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique. 
# 
#  The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1À¢·µó place athlete 
# has the highest score, the 2‚Åø·µà place athlete has the 2‚Åø·µà highest score, and so on.
#  The placement of each athlete determines their rank: 
# 
#  
#  The 1À¢·µó place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal". 
#  The 2‚Åø·µà place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal". 
#  The 3 ≥·µà place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal". 
#  For the 4·µó ∞ place to the n·µó ∞ place athlete, their rank is their placement 
# number (i.e., the x·µó ∞ place athlete's rank is "x"). 
#  
# 
#  Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the i·µó ∞ 
# athlete. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
# Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
# Explanation: The placements are [1À¢·µó, 2‚Åø·µà, 3 ≥·µà, 4·µó ∞, 5·µó ∞]. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
# Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
# Explanation: The placements are [1À¢·µó, 5·µó ∞, 3 ≥·µà, 2‚Åø·µà, 4·µó ∞].
# 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  n == score.length 
#  1 <= n <= 10‚Å¥ 
#  0 <= score[i] <= 10‚Å∂ 
#  All the values in score are unique.
