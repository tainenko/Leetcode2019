# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest consecutive
# sequence path.
#
#  The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node
# in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path
# needs to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,null,3,2,null,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.
#
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10‚Å¥].
#  -3 * 10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 3 * 10‚Å¥
