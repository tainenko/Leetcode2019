# Design a queue-like data structure that moves the most recently used element 
# to the end of the queue. 
# 
#  Implement the MRUQueue class: 
# 
#  
#  MRUQueue(int n) constructs the MRUQueue with n elements: [1,2,3,...,n]. 
#  int fetch(int k) moves the k·µó ∞ element (1-indexed) to the end of the queue 
# and returns it. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input:
# ["MRUQueue", "fetch", "fetch", "fetch", "fetch"]
# [[8], [3], [5], [2], [8]]
# Output:
# [null, 3, 6, 2, 2]
# 
# Explanation:
# MRUQueue mRUQueue = new MRUQueue(8); // Initializes the queue to [1,2,3,4,5,6,
# 7,8].
# mRUQueue.fetch(3); // Moves the 3 ≥·µà element (3) to the end of the queue to 
# become [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,3] and returns it.
# mRUQueue.fetch(5); // Moves the 5·µó ∞ element (6) to the end of the queue to 
# become [1,2,4,5,7,8,3,6] and returns it.
# mRUQueue.fetch(2); // Moves the 2‚Åø·µà element (2) to the end of the queue to 
# become [1,4,5,7,8,3,6,2] and returns it.
# mRUQueue.fetch(8); // The 8·µó ∞ element (2) is already at the end of the queue 
# so just return it.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 2000 
#  1 <= k <= n 
#  At most 2000 calls will be made to fetch. 
#  
# 
#  
# Follow up: Finding an 
# O(n) algorithm per 
# fetch is a bit easy. Can you find an algorithm with a better complexity for 
# each 
# fetch call?
