# You are given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n. 
# 
#  Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way: 
# 
#  
#  Start with the head as the current node. 
#  Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node. 
#  Remove the next n nodes 
#  Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list. 
#  
# 
#  Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3
# Output: [1,2,6,7,11,12]
# Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the 
# linked List  (1 ->2) show in black nodes.
# Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.
# Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
# Head of the linked list after removing nodes is returned.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 1, n = 3
# Output: [1,5,9]
# Explanation: Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Å∂ 
#  1 <= m, n <= 1000 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Could you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?
