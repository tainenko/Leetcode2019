# There is a battle and n heroes are trying to defeat m monsters. You are given 
# two 1-indexed arrays of positive integers heroes and monsters of length n and m,
#  respectively. heroes[i] is the power of iᵗʰ hero, and monsters[i] is the power 
# of iᵗʰ monster. 
# 
#  The iᵗʰ hero can defeat the jᵗʰ monster if monsters[j] <= heroes[i]. 
# 
#  You are also given a 1-indexed array coins of length m consisting of 
# positive integers. coins[i] is the number of coins that each hero earns after defeating 
# the iᵗʰ monster. 
# 
#  Return an array ans of length n where ans[i] is the maximum number of coins 
# that the iᵗʰ hero can collect from this battle. 
# 
#  Notes 
# 
#  
#  The health of a hero doesn't get reduced after defeating a monster. 
#  Multiple heroes can defeat a monster, but each monster can be defeated by a 
# given hero only once. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: heroes = [1,4,2], monsters = [1,1,5,2,3], coins = [2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [5,16,10]
# Explanation: For each hero, we list the index of all the monsters he can 
# defeat:
# 1ˢᵗ hero: [1,2] since the power of this hero is 1 and monsters[1], monsters[2]
#  <= 1. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] = 5 coins.
# 2ⁿᵈ hero: [1,2,4,5] since the power of this hero is 4 and monsters[1], 
# monsters[2], monsters[4], monsters[5] <= 4. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] +
#  coins[4] + coins[5] = 16 coins.
# 3ʳᵈ hero: [1,2,4] since the power of this hero is 2 and monsters[1], monsters[
# 2], monsters[4] <= 2. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[4] = 10 
# coins.
# So the answer would be [5,16,10]. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: heroes = [5], monsters = [2,3,1,2], coins = [10,6,5,2]
# Output: [23]
# Explanation: This hero can defeat all the monsters since monsters[i] <= 5. So 
# he collects all of the coins: coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[3] + coins[4] = 23, 
# and the answer would be [23].
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: heroes = [4,4], monsters = [5,7,8], coins = [1,1,1]
# Output: [0,0]
# Explanation: In this example, no hero can defeat a monster. So the answer 
# would be [0,0],
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n == heroes.length <= 10⁵ 
#  1 <= m == monsters.length <= 10⁵ 
#  coins.length == m 
#  1 <= heroes[i], monsters[i], coins[i] <= 10⁹
