# A subsequence of a string is good if it is not empty and the frequency of 
# each one of its characters is the same. 
# 
#  Given a string s, return the number of good subsequences of s. Since the 
# answer may be too large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
# 
#  A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by 
# deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "aabb"
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The total number of subsequences is 2‚Å¥. There are five 
# subsequences which are not good: "aabb", "aabb", "aabb", "aabb", and the empty 
# subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is 2‚Å¥-5 = 11. 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "leet"
# Output: 12
# Explanation: There are four subsequences which are not good: "leet", "leet", 
# "leet", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is 2‚Å¥-4
#  = 12.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "abcd"
# Output: 15
# Explanation: All of the non-empty subsequences are good subsequences. Hence, 
# the number of good subsequences is 2‚Å¥-1 = 15.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length <= 10‚Å¥ 
#  s consists of only lowercase English letters.
