# There are n types of units indexed from 0 to n - 1. 
# 
#  You are given a 2D integer array conversions of length n - 1, where 
# conversions[i] = [sourceUniti, targetUniti, conversionFactori]. This indicates that a 
# single unit of type sourceUniti is equivalent to conversionFactori units of type 
# targetUniti. 
# 
#  You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length q, where queries[i] =
#  [unitAi, unitBi]. 
# 
#  Return an array answer of length q where answer[i] is the number of units of 
# type unitBi equivalent to 1 unit of type unitAi, and can be represented as p/q 
# where p and q are coprime. Return each answer[i] as pq‚Åª¬π modulo 10‚Åπ + 7, where q‚Åª
# ¬π represents the multiplicative inverse of q modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
#  Input: conversions = [[0,1,2],[0,2,6]], queries = [[1,2],[1,0]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [3,500000004] 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  In the first query, we can convert unit 1 into 3 units of type 2 using the 
# inverse of conversions[0], then conversions[1]. 
#  In the second query, we can convert unit 1 into 1/2 units of type 0 using 
# the inverse of conversions[0]. We return 500000004 since it is the multiplicative 
# inverse of 2. 
#  
# 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
#  Input: conversions = [[0,1,2],[0,2,6],[0,3,8],[2,4,2],[2,5,4],[3,6,3]], 
# queries = [[1,2],[0,4],[6,5],[4,6],[6,1]] 
#  
# 
#  Output: [3,12,1,2,83333334] 
# 
#  Explanation: 
# 
#  
#  In the first query, we can convert unit 1 into 3 units of type 2 using the 
# inverse of conversions[0], then conversions[1]. 
#  In the second query, we can convert unit 0 into 12 units of type 4 using 
# conversions[1], then conversions[3]. 
#  In the third query, we can convert unit 6 into 1 unit of type 5 using the 
# inverse of conversions[5], the inverse of conversions[2], conversions[1], then 
# conversions[4]. 
#  In the fourth query, we can convert unit 4 into 2 units of type 6 using the 
# inverse of conversions[3], the inverse of conversions[1], conversions[2], then 
# conversions[5]. 
#  In the fifth query, we can convert unit 6 into 1/12 units of type 1 using 
# the inverse of conversions[5], the inverse of conversions[2], then conversions[0]. 
# We return 83333334 since it is the multiplicative inverse of 12. 
#  
# 
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  2 <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
#  conversions.length == n - 1 
#  0 <= sourceUniti, targetUniti < n 
#  1 <= conversionFactori <= 10‚Åπ 
#  1 <= q <= 10‚Åµ 
#  queries.length == q 
#  0 <= unitAi, unitBi < n 
#  It is guaranteed that unit 0 can be uniquely converted into any other unit 
# through a combination of forward or backward conversions.
