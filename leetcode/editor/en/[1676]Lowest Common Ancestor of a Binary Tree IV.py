# Given the root of a binary tree and an array of TreeNode objects nodes, 
# return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all the nodes in nodes. All the nodes will 
# exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are unique. 
# 
#  Extending the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of 
# n nodes p1, p2, ..., pn in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has every pi 
# as a descendant (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself) for every 
# valid i". A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x 
# to some leaf node. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [4,7]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of nodes 4 and 7 is node 2.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of a single node is the node itself.
#  
# 
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [7,6,2,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of the nodes 7, 6, 2, and 4 is node 5.
# 
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  All nodes[i] will exist in the tree. 
#  All nodes[i] are distinct.
