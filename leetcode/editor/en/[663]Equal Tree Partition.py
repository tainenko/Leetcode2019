# Given the root of a binary tree, return true if you can partition the tree 
# into two trees with equal sums of values after removing exactly one edge on the 
# original tree. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [5,10,10,null,null,2,3]
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,10,null,null,2,20]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You cannot split the tree into two trees with equal sums after 
# removing exactly one edge on the tree.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
