# Given a string s, return all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates)
#  of it. 
# 
#  You may return the answer in any order. If s has no palindromic permutation, 
# return an empty list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: s = "aabb"
# Output: ["abba","baab"]
#  
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: s = "abc"
