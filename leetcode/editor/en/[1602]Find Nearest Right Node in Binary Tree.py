# Given the root of a binary tree and a node u in the tree, return the nearest 
# node on the same level that is to the right of u, or return null if u is the 
# rightmost node in its level. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is 
# node 5.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,null,4,2], u = 2
# Output: null
# Explanation: There are no nodes to the right of 2.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  All values in the tree are distinct. 
#  u is a node in the binary tree rooted at root.
