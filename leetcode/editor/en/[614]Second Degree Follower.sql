#Table: Follow 
#
# 
#+-------------+---------+
#| Column Name | Type    |
#+-------------+---------+
#| followee    | varchar |
#| follower    | varchar |
#+-------------+---------+
#(followee, follower) is the primary key column for this table.
#Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user 
#followee on a social network.
#There will not be a user following themself.
# 
#
# 
#
# A second-degree follower is a user who: 
#
# 
# follows at least one user, and 
# is followed by at least one user. 
# 
#
# Write an SQL query to report the second-degree users and the number of their 
#followers. 
#
# Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order. 
#
# The query result format is in the following example. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: 
#Follow table:
#+----------+----------+
#| followee | follower |
#+----------+----------+
#| Alice    | Bob      |
#| Bob      | Cena     |
#| Bob      | Donald   |
#| Donald   | Edward   |
#+----------+----------+
#Output: 
#+----------+-----+
#| follower | num |
#+----------+-----+
#| Bob      | 2   |
#| Donald   | 1   |
#+----------+-----+
#Explanation: 
#User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows 
#Alice, so we include him in the result table.
#User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he 
#follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.
#User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she 
#does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.
